DiceDB is a fork of [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) with additional capabilities
that provides high-performance, Redis-compatible in-memory data structure server
and data store. As Valkey itself is a fork of Redis, DiceDB maintains full
compatibility with the Redis and Valkey ecosystem, including all SDKs, tools,
and client libraries.

## Architecture

DiceDB is architecturally based on Valkey, which means you may encounter Valkey references in:

- Server logs and metrics
- Codebase and internal documentation

For commands, behavior, and base configuration, you can refer
to [Valkey](https://valkey.io) unless specific DiceDB
features are noted.

## Key Features

### Disk Spilling

DiceDB's offers [dicedb-spill](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-spill), which provides:

- Automatic persistence of evicted keys to disk storage (RocksDB)
- Transparent restoration of spilled keys on cache misses
- Larger working sets within fixed memory budgets
- Seamless operation without application-level changes

This architecture allows you to work with datasets larger than
available RAM while maintaining in-memory performance for hot data.

## Compatibility

DiceDB is fully compatible with:

- Redis and Valkey clients and SDKs across all languages
- Redis commands and data structures
- Redis and Valkey tooling and ecosystem
- Existing Redis and Valkey workflows and deployment patterns

## Platform Support

DiceDB runs on multiple platforms and architectures:

- Operating Systems: Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD
- Architectures: 32-bit and 64-bit, little-endian and big-endian systems

## Use Cases

- all the scenarios you were using Redis or Valkey
- memory budget is constrained but working set is large
- cost optimization is needed without sacrificing Redis compatibility

## Legacy Version

DiceDB originally started as a Golang-based storage engine
focused on reactivity and high throughput. That implementation
has been archived at [dice-legacy](https://github.com/dicedb/dice-legacy).
Select features from the legacy engine are being gradually ported
into the current Valkey-based codebase.
