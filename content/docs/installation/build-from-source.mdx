DiceDB supports Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD. Building
from source gives you the latest features and allows you to
customize the build options.

## Prerequisites

Before building DiceDB, ensure you have:

- A C compiler (GCC or Clang)
- Make
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Clone

DiceDB uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
and hence while cloning the repository make sure you pass the `--recursive` flag

```bash
git clone git@github.com/dicedb/dice --recursive
```

## Building DiceDB

### Basic Compilation

The simplest way to build DiceDB is:

```bash
make
```

This will compile DiceDB with default settings for your platform.

### Build Options

DiceDB supports several optional build features:

#### TLS Support

To enable Transport Layer Security:

```bash
# Integrated TLS support
make BUILD_TLS=yes

# Module-based TLS
make BUILD_TLS=module
```

#### RDMA Support (Experimental)

For RDMA support:

```bash
# Integrated RDMA
make BUILD_RDMA=yes

# Module-based RDMA
make BUILD_RDMA=module
```

#### Systemd Integration

To enable systemd support on Linux:

```bash
make USE_SYSTEMD=yes
```

#### Fast Float Optimization

For optimized performance with sorted sets:

```bash
make USE_FAST_FLOAT=yes
```

#### 32-bit Build

To build a 32-bit binary:

```bash
make 32bit
```

#### Custom Binary Suffix

To append a custom suffix to program names:

```bash
make PROG_SUFFIX="-custom"
```

## Testing

After compilation, validate your build:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-unit      # Unit tests
make test-modules   # Module tests
make test-cluster   # Cluster tests
```

## Installation

Install the compiled binaries to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
make install
```

By default, this installs to `/usr/local/bin`. You can customize the installation prefix:

```bash
make PREFIX=/opt/dicedb install
```

## Production Setup (Linux)

For production deployments on Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can use the provided
utility script to configure init scripts and configuration files:

```bash
cd utils
./install_server.sh
```

This script will:

- Create the necessary directories
- Configure the init script
- Set up the default configuration
- Start the DiceDB service

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, verify that DiceDB is working:

```bash
# Start the server
dicedb-server

# In another terminal, connect with the CLI
dicedb-cli ping
```

You should receive a `PONG` response.
