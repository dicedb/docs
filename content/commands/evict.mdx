## Syntax

```
EVICT key [key ...]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description                          | Type   | Required |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------ | -------- |
| `key`     | One or more keys to evict from memory | String | Yes      |

## Return Value

| Condition                           | Return Value                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Keys evicted successfully           | `OK`                                                |
| Key does not exist                  | Key is ignored, no error is raised                  |

## Behaviour

When `EVICT` is called, DiceDB removes the specified keys from its in-memory store and
delegates them to the configured storage backend (e.g., [dicedb-spill](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-spill)).
This is useful for tiered storage setups where you want to proactively move infrequently
accessed keys out of memory to free up space.

If a key does not exist, it is silently ignored. The command accepts multiple keys
in a single call for batch eviction.

## Examples

Evict a single key:

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET mykey "hello"
OK
127.0.0.1:7379> EVICT mykey
OK
```

Evict multiple keys:

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET key1 "a"
OK
127.0.0.1:7379> SET key2 "b"
OK
127.0.0.1:7379> EVICT key1 key2
OK
```

## Notes

- This command is specific to DiceDB and is not available in Valkey or Redis.
- The `EVICT` command works in conjunction with the `PREMISS` and `PREEVICTION` hooks, which enable tiered storage support through [dicedb-spill](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-spill).
